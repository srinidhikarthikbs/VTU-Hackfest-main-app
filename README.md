# E-Governance Student Progress Dashboard

This application is developed to assist the Government in improving the educational facilities in identified regions. The idea is to fetch student performance data state-wise, district-wise, taluk-wise and so on, and visualize them using graphs so that they can be compared first-hand remotely and in real-time.

## Getting Started

This is an android application, having back-end in PHP. MySQL is used as the database for simplicity. 

To run the application or to import into a project, you would need to get Android Studio installed and the project cloned.

[Coming Soon - The back-end for the application!!]
(I am taking some time to setup)
